## Exporting student submissions

Students may export their project submissions into their personal Replit accounts to maintain access when they are removed from a Team or a Team is archived.

To export their projects from a team, students can go to `https://replit.com/teams/TEAM-USERNAME/export`. 

For example, if the team username is @teamsEduDemo, then the link would direct students to log into their accounts, then go to: `https://replit.com/teams/teamsEduDemo/export`

## Archiving teams

Teams that are no longer in use may be archived by visiting your Teams dashboard, expanding the menu next to the team you wish to archive, and selecting "Archive".

Once you archive a team, members will still be able access repls created in this Team, but they cannot create new repls within it. 

You can unarchive your team at any time.

- Instructors can [copy Team Projects from an archived team to a new team](https://docs.replit.com/Teams/projectCopying).
