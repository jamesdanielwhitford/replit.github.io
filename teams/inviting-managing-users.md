# Inviting and managing users (teachers and students)

You can assign different members of your team different roles. These roles have already been defined [here](/teams/intro-teams-education). There are different ways to add the users to your team, which we're going to look at. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
* Invite teachers and students
* Invite anonymous users
* Assign user roles
* Assign nicknames

## Inviting teachers and students

To invite people with their Replit username or email address, follow the steps during [team creation](https://docs.replit.com/teams/creating-managing-teams).

If you've already created a team, navigate to your [team dashboard](https://replit.com/teams), click on your chosen team username, and then click "Manage team members".

You may add team members by:

1. Entering the email or username of an existing user.
2. Inviting via link (link does not expire).
3. Uploading a CSV of emails or usernames.
4. Invite via Google Classroom, covered [here](/teams/integrating-other-platforms#Adding Students to a Team from Google Classrooms)

##  Invite Anonymous Members in Privacy Mode
>Please note that your students must be added in Privacy Mode in order for your team to remain FERPA/COPPA compliant.

To protect the privacy of students and remain compliant with privacy regulations, you can anonymously invite your students to Replit and to your education team. This privacy invite method only works when signing up via a team invite link.

1. Go to your team, click "Manage team members".
2. Check the box next to "Do not collect names/emails".

You can share this link with your students. When signing up from this link, they will not be required to enter an email address. Once they have signed up, they will automatically be added to your team.

## Assigning user roles

You can assign roles to members who are part of your team by navigating to your [team dashboard](https://replit.com/teams) and choosing "Manage team members".

## Assigning nicknames

Team nicknames allow teachers, and other admins, the ability to assign nicknames to their students. 

### Common Uses
- Student Privacy
  - Students that sign up using the privacy enabled link are assigned a random username. In the past it has been up to the teachers to keep track of which student belonged to which generated username. Nicknames will allow teachers to assign the correct name to the student without violating COPPA regulations. 
- Sectioning Students
  - Teachers who use Teams for multiple class sections or cohorts can now sort their students' submissions by section by assigning nicknames with identifiers such as section number or cohort year.

### How to use
- Open the 'Manage team members' modal on the home screen of a team. 
- Double click on any member's name.
- An input box will appear.
- Enter the nickname you wish the member to have and press the enter key.
- The nickname will be created.

To update and delete a nickname:
- Click on the name in the 'Manage team members' modal. 
- The input box will appear with the nickname pre-loaded.
- Update the nickname and press enter.
- To delete the nickname completely, remove all characters from the input box and press the enter key.
