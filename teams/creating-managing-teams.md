# Creating and Managing Teams

A team is a collaborative workspace for teachers and students. To create teams, you first need to ensure that you are the owner and/or organization administrator. 

In this tutorial, you'll:
* Learn how to sign up
* Invite team members
* Create teams
* Update teams
* Archive teams

## How to Sign Up

If you don't already have an account, sign up at [Replit](https://replit.com). Now click on [Teams](https://replit.com/teams) in the sidebar on the left.

### Inviting Teammates

Add a team profile picture and [invite some users](https://docs.replit.com/Teams/Invitations). 
*Users who are added to a team and assigned the `Admin` role will be able to create their own teams within an organization.*

Now you can start [building out your classroom materials](./Projects)! 

### Creating Teams 

If you'd like to create a new team in your organization, simply go to your [Teams Dashboard](https://replit.com/teams) and click "Add Team".

### Archiving Teams

Teams that are no longer in use may be archived by visiting your Teams dashboard, expanding the menu next to the team you wish to archive, and selecting "Archive".

Once you archive a team, members will still be able access repls created in this Team, but they cannot create new repls within it. 

You can unarchive your team at any time.
