# Testing, assessments, and autograding

Replit has a number of features related to helping teachers automatically grade students' assignments.

The simplest of these is [Input/Output testing](./InputOutput), which allows you to check that your student's homework produces specific outputs, matching exact strings or regexes.

A step above this is [Unit Testing](/repls/UnitTesting), which allows you to write full unit tests in Java (JUnit), Python (unittest), or JavaScript (Jest).

## Input/output testing

Repl input/output testing allows a teacher to create simple tests that automatically match input values to expected output in student projects. Students can also easily test their code before submitting projects, which improves persistence. You can even use regular expressions (regex) for complex, flexible pattern matching.

There is also a video explanation available [here](https://www.loom.com/share/a8664cccb66342419f7d1b9d8f33c0ed).

Once your project is created, you'll find the "Input/Output Tests" window by clicking <img src="/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/in-out-icon.png" style="width: 38px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;"> in the left side bar.

### Creating a Project with Input/Output Tests

Ideally, after creating your project, you should:

1. Add instructions for the student.
2. Write some skeleton code for the student.
3. Configure the Input/Output tests (we will explain how shortly).
4. Publish the project for students to start.

Let's look at the different testing options, each following the above sequence.

### Match Tests

A match test is passed if the expected output is in (or equal to) the actual output. In other words, the actual output does not have to be identical to the expected output, it must just include it. The JavaScript equivalent is `actualOutput.includes(expectedOutput)`. 

Let's say we have a test on string formatting in Python. 

We have created a README.md file with the student's instructions.

![Image showing match README.md](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-readme.png)

We have created some skeleton code for the student to start from.

![Image showing match main.py](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-skeleton-code.png)

Now we can create the test.

Open the "Input/Output Tests" pane from the left sidebar and click on "+ Create test".

![Image showing Create test button](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/create-test.png)

A modal window will pop up where you can configure the input and output of the test. 

![Image showing match test config](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-config.png)

Above, we create the test with the following steps:

1. Give the test a name.
2. Leave the input blank as it's not needed for this test.
3. Specify "John Smith" for the output.
4. Select "match" for the test type.

We are selecting "match" for this test because we don't want an exact match. Students can write their own welcome message, however, the full name "John Smith" must be part of the output string. 

Once the test is created, it'll be listed under "Input/Output Tests" and you can delete or modify it from there. To edit the test, click on the pencil icon next to the test name.

![Image showing match test created](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-test-created.png)

We now have a complete project for students to work on. Let's publish the project and look at the testing from the student's perspective.

![Image showing the publishing button](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/publish-unpublished.gif)

Once published, the students will get a notification that a new project has been published. Clicking on the notification opens the team's projects page where they can find the new project. They will click on "Start project" to open it.

![Student Notification](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/student-notification.png)

The student will be greeted with the project instructions `README.md file` added earlier. 

The `main.py` file has the skeleton code we added, and they can start working from there. 

Let's open the input/output tests and run the String-Formatting test as a student. It will fail now, because we haven't added any code.

![Image showing student running the test- fail](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-test-failing.png)

The student can check the results to see what the expected output should be.

![Image showing failed results match](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-test-fail-results.png)

Let's add some code to make the test pass. We'll change the code to print the full name and then run the test again.

![Image showing string-code](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-test-passed.png)

Checking the "passed" results now, you'll see that the expected output only has the full name "John Smith", whereas the actual output has a string with some other words in it. With match tests, this will pass because the expected output is present within the actual output. If the name was incorrectly printed ie. "Smith John", then this test would fail. If you want an exact match, you can use "exact" for the input/output test type.

![Image showing the passed results](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/match-passed-results.png)

### Exact Tests 

Exact tests pass only if the expected output is equal to the actual output (although we allow a trailing newline). The equivalent to this in JavaScript is `expectedOutput === actualOutput || expectedOutput + '\n' === actualOutput`.

Creating an exact test is similar to the match test created above. 

As an example, we'll create an assignment where students have to write the formula to calculate the area of a circle using the `math` module. To test that the student uses `math.pi` instead of some variable like `pi=3.14`, we will use the exact input/output test.

We have already created the skeleton code and README.md file, so now we'll create the test.

![Image showing the exact test config](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/exact-test-config.png)

Above, we create an exact test that will check for exactly the areas specified within the expected output. Follow the below steps to create an exact test.

1. Open the "Input/Output Tests" pane.
2. Click on "+ Create test".
3. Name the test.
4. Add the exact expected output.
5. Choose "exact" as the test type and click the save button.

You can now publish the project. Students will get a notification that the project is published.

From the students' perspective, they'll have the skeleton code, and the README.md file with instructions to complete the project.

If they run the test, it will fail because we haven't added any code to the skeleton yet. Students can check the expected output by checking the test results.

The student can then add their code to the main.py file with the skeleton code and run the test again to see if they passed.

Below we have code that uses the incorrect representation of `pi` and because we are using exact tests, the test is failing. 

![Image showing incorrect pi test fail](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/exact-failed-pi-results.png)

Then, when we import the math module and use `math.pi`, we get the correct answer that matches exactly with the expected output, so our test passes, and it is safe for the student to submit their code.

![Image showing exact test passing ](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/exact-test-pass.png)

When a student submits a project without running the tests first, they will get a notification asking them to run tests first or submit anyway. This is a reminder for students to test their work before submitting as it will give them a good indication whether the work they did is correct.

![Image showing submit without running test](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/submit-without-testing.png)

When a student tries to submit a project while tests are failing, they will also get a notification making them aware of the fact, with an option to "View tests" or "Submit anyway".

![Image showing submission with failing tests](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/submit-with-failing-tests.png)

### Regex Tests

For more flexibility in defining the expected output, you can use regular expressions or "regex". The regex test is the third type of input/output test.

The test passes if the test matches the expected output compiled as a regex. This is equivalent to `actualOutput.match(expectedOutput)`.

As an example, we have a project where the student has to write code that will compile email addresses from the given variables. 

For the test, we'll set up a regex test to check that the student's email address matches the required email format.

![Image showing regex test config](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/regex-test-config.png)

To create the test seen above:

1. Open the "Input/Output Tests" pane.
2. Create a new test.
3. Give the test a name.
4. Add the regex expression to the "Expected output".
5. Choose "regex" as the test type and click save.

When we add the code to compile the email address and run the test, we get the following results.

![Image showing regex passed results](/images/teamsForEducation/input-output-tests/regex-pass-results.png)

If you don't want to be lenient of an extra newline and prefer to have a truly exact match with the expected output and actual output, you can use the `regex` with a `^` at the start and `$` at the end. Keep in mind though, that you'll have to escape the other regex characters.

Test cases can be added, edited, and deleted at any time â€“ even after the project has been published. This added flexibility allows you to get started with testing right away. 

### While I/O tests work with most languages on Replit, there are just a few exceptions:
* APL
* Basic
* Bloop
* BrainF
* Coffeescript
* Emoticon
* Forth
* HTML, CSS, JS
* Kaboom

* Unlambda

## Unit testing

Repl unit testing allows a repl author to create code-driven tests that compare actual function output with expected output. 

### Supported Languages and Testing Frameworks

- Java â€“ [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)
- Python â€“ [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- Node.js â€“ [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started)

### Why Use Unit Testing?

Unit testing is great for more complicated testing scenarios. For example, when you need to test that functions return specific values based on their (dynamic) inputs.

Each test is itself a function that follows a pattern:

- Invoke one function from your application with parameters.
- Compare the return value to an expected value (your function should always have predictable outputs)
- If the actual value does not match the expected value, throw an exception.

Here's an example using Java: 
```
// invoke with 3.0, 4.0 as input
double area = calculateRectArea(3.0, 4.0);
// compare expected to actual
assertEqual(12.0, actual);
```

Unit testing is not ideal for testing that involves using Standard In (`System.in`) and Standard Out (`System.out`). Input/Output testing is ideal for testing that relies on precise usage of `println()`. 

### Using the Testing Pane

The testing pane can be found in your left-hand sidebar in your repl. It is your hub for creating tests. Read on to find out more about how to use this helpful feature. 

### Defining a test function

Open the testing pane within a project.

![unit testing pane](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-pane.png)

If prompted, select "Unit tests".

<img src="/images/unit-testing/testing-method.png" style="width: 200px;">

Write a function within the main file that's easy to test: something which accepts parameters and returns a single result. Our example includes an `add` function which simply returns the result of adding two numbers.

In a Python repl:

![unit testing main py](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-add-py.png)

In a Node.js repl:

![unit testing index js](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-add-js.png)

Click "+ Add test".

![unit testing add test](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-add-test.png)

Providing a test will construct a unit test function for you. Only the body of the function is editable. Configure the test to invoke the `add` function and compare the result to the expected value. **If the actual value does not match the expected value, the assert method with throw an exception and cause the test to fail.** Include a helpful failure message to explain the intent of the test. 

Note: Python exposes its assert methods on the `self` object. This behavior will be different depending on the language you use. See the "Assertion documentation" below to read about the invocation patterns for each unit testing framework.

In a Python repl:

![unit testing add modal](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-add-modal.png)

In a Node.js repl:

![unit testing add modal js](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-add-modal-js.png)

Note: by default, in a Node.js repl, the exports are available via an `index` variable, e.g. `index.add` here. You can add your own imports too, see the "Importing Libraries" section.

Click "Run tests" to begin executing your test suite. Open the Console tab to monitor execution progress. 

![unit testing running](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-running.png)

Test results will appear in the Console.

![unit testing results](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-results.png)


### Importing libraries

Imports can be configured in the "Setup" for the test suite, which is helpful if:
* Your repl has library dependencies.
* You would like to include any other library just for testing purposes. 

For example, you can import [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for all tests. Keep in mind that this will affect all test functions within your test suite (you will not need to import more than once):

![unit test setup](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-import.png)

Here is an example function using NumPy:

![unit test numpy](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-np-example.png)

Every other test you write can also use NumPy:

![unit test numpy](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-np-test.png)

### Importing modules

If you would like to test multiple modules or files within your repl, you must manually import them in the "Setup".

![unit test import module](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-import-module.png)

### Advanced Setup and Teardown

Sometimes tests require specific setup and teardown steps to configure and destroy global state. 

Consider a repl that relies on Repl Database and loads specific data by key.

![unit testing database](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-database.png)

### Import

Use import to include Repl Database.

![unit testing db import](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-db-import.png)

### Setup

Use the setup to add a database key with test data:

![unit testing setup](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-setup.png)

### Teardown
Use the teardown to delete the test data:

![unit testing teardown](/images/unit-testing/unit-testing-teardown.png)

### Assertion Documentation

Read about the supported assert function for each unit testing library:

- Java â€“ [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/latest/org/junit/Assert.html)
- Python â€“ [unittest assert methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#assert-methods)
- Node.js â€“ [Jest expect functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect)


### Tips for Writing Good Tests

- Only test one expected output at a time.
- Avoid relying on external libraries when possible.
- Avoid testing functions that rely on the entire app running (e.g. databases, network connections, rendering user-interfaces).
- Avoid testing functions that are not crucial portions of the program.
- Avoid testing functions that are part of external libraries. 

### Tips for Writing "Testable" Functions

- Decompose your program into discrete functions.
- Keep functions concise and descriptive. 
- Design predictable inputs (parameters) and outputs (return).
