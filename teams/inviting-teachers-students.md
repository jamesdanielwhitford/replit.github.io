# Inviting teachers and students


To invite people with their Replit username or email address, follow the steps during [team creation](https://docs.replit.com/teams/intro-teams-education). 


If you've already created a team, navigate to your [team dashboard](https://replit.com/teams), click on your chosen team username, and then click "Manage team members".

You may add team members by:

2. Inviting via link (link does not expire).
3. Uploading a CSV of emails or usernames.

## Invite Anonymous Members in Privacy Mode
>Please note that your students must be added in Privacy Mode in order for your team to remain FERPA/COPPA compliant.

To protect the privacy of students and remain compliant with privacy regulations, you can anonymously invite your students to Replit and to your education team. This privacy invite method only works when signing up via a team invite link.

1. Go to your team, click "Add more" and click "Generate a team invite link".
2. Check the box next to "Do not collect names/emails".

You can share this link with your students. When signing up from this link, they will not be required to enter an email address. Once they have signed up, they will automatically be added to your team.
