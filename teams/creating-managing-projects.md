# Creating and managing projects

**Team Projects** are projects and assignments that teachers can set up with starter code, instructions, and materials for their students. When starting a Team Project, students duplicate their own, private versions of the Team Projects to edit and customize freely.

*Team Projects are private by default and are visible and editable only by the teacher and each individual student or student group.* 

>**Please note that Team Repls were deprecated in October 2021.**

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
* Create team projects
* Create different types of projects
* Organize projects into units
* Copy projects to other teams

## Creating Team Projects
From your team dashboard, create a new project.

<img style="width: 500px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/curriculum-authoring/Create_project_button.png" />

Enter the project details and select whether this will be a group project. Group projects and other types are discussed below. You'll be redirected to the IDE to add any comments, tests, and initial coding blocks you'd like your students to start from. You'll assign groups when you publish the project. 

Use the [Lesson Authoring tool](https://docs.replit.com/teams/lesson-authoring) to write read-only instructions for your students to follow as well as admin-only lesson plans where you can stash your class notes.

### Publishing

When you are done editing your project and it is ready to be published, click "Publish project" from the IDE. Once published, your project will be viewable and editable by all members assigned to that project. 

<img style="width: 500px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/project-publish-button.png" />

A modal appears, where you can toggle the project between "Published" and "Unpublished". You can store notes and demos as unpublished Team Projects. Unpublished projects are not visible to your students at all.

### Submitting Student Work 

When students have completed their work on the project, they click "Submit" in the IDE header, which will notify all teachers of their submission. Students may continue working on projects and resubmit them after hitting "Submit."

## Individual, Group, and Self-Grouping Projects

*View a video explainer on Group Assignments [here](https://www.loom.com/share/6e59d7e609b7485b8bf21efa8468a610).*

### Individual projects 
Students are able to fork the project and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and team admins can see and edit their work. 

### Group projects
You can assign students into submission groups to collaborate. Click "Auto Assign" to automatically assign all students into equal groups or assign each group manually. You can add and remove new groups, drag and drop students between groups, and search for students. Groups cannot be removed after saving, but students may be reassigned into different groups later.

### Self-Grouping Projects 
Allow students to create and join their own groups. 

Here's what your students will see when a project allows for self-grouping: 

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/groups/group_project_student_view.png" />

If no groups are created, they'll have the option to create their own: 

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/groups/student_create_group.png" />

If groups have already been created, they may either join one or create their own: 

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/groups/student_selectcreate_group.png" />

Click "Save" to finalize any changes, or "Cancel" to discard changes.

## Organizing Projects 

Once Team Projects are created, you may organize them into units.

### Creating Units 
Begin by clicking on the **+** icon at the top right of your Team to create a unit. 

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/create_unit.gif" />

### Organizing Projects Into Units
Next, drag and drop your projects into the correct units in the order you would like them to appear in for your students. 

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/move_projects.gif" />

### Editing Units 
To change the name of a unit, click on the three dots to the right of the unit and select "Edit unit". 

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/organizing-projects/edit-unit.gif" />

### Reordering Units 
To reorder units, select the list icon on the top right of your Team. Use the up and down arrows to define the order of your units.

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/organizing-projects/reorder-units.gif" />

### Deleting Units 
To delete a unit, click on the three dots to the right of the unit select "Delete unit".

## Copying projects to other teams

Teachers can bulk copy and share projects to any Team. This feature is useful for a single teacher managing multiple classes, sharing curricula with your colleagues, or duplicating projects within a team or from one semester to the next. Sharing and bulk copying is managed using a secure private link that is created by the team admin. 

Follow the steps below:

1. Click on "Share projects" :

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/share_projects_button.png" />

2. Click on "+ Create a new link". This creates the link you'll share with others.

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/copyProjectTwo.png" />

3. You can choose all or a specific subset of assignments you want to be linked with the URL you are creating.

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/copyProjectThree.png" />

4. This is the final link that you can share with others (you can edit it). You can also create new links as needed; the old ones will not be removed. This is useful if you want to share different projects with different people/teams. You can also delete the link so that it can no longer be used.

<img style="width: 600px" src="/images/teamsForEducation/copyProjectFour.png" />

5. To import the projects into a new team, open the link you created, then select the team you'd like to update as well as the projects you want to import into the team. To duplicate projects within the same team, simply select the original team name to import the projects into.
