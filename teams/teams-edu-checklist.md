# Checklist: Getting Started with Teams for Education

### For Organization Admins:

1. Start by [signing up for a Team for Education](https://docs.replit.com/teams/intro-teams-education). Now you are an organization admin and can view all of the teams within your organization.
2. Create a “home” team and [invite all of the teachers](https://docs.replit.com/teams/inviting-teachers-students) who will be using Replit with you to join it.
3. Once they’ve joined your home team, [assign them all “Admin” roles](https://docs.replit.com/teams/assigning-user-roles). Doing so will give them the ability to view and edit Team Projects within the team!

### For Teachers: 
1. Click on “Add Team” to begin creating your first team. Now you’re the team owner!
2. [Give your team a username.](https://docs.replit.com/teams/intro-teams-education) (Don’t worry, you can always update your team’s display name later!)
3. [Invite your students and TAs.](https://docs.replit.com/teams/inviting-teachers-students) Only the team owner can assign user roles. *Please note that students **must** be added using private invites for your team to be FERPA/COPPA compliant.*
4. Now you can begin [creating projects and assignments for your students to complete!](https://docs.replit.com/teams/creating-projects-assignments) You can build your own projects from scratch, [import them from your colleagues or other teams](https://docs.replit.com/teams/copying-projects-other-teams), or [import them from the Replit Curriculum Hub](https://replit.com/curriculum)!
