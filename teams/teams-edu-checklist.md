# Checklist: Getting Started with Teams for Education

The checklist is a helpful tool to get you started with Teams for Education. 

### For Organization Admins:

Organization admins can create and view all of the teams within the organization.

1. Start by [signing up](./creating-managing-teams) for a Team for Education. 
2. Create a “home” team and [invite](./inviting-managing-users#inviting-teachers-students) all of the teachers who will be using Replit with you to join it.
3. Once they’ve joined your home team, [assign them all “Admin” roles](./inviting-managing-users#assigning-user-roles). Doing so will give them the ability to view and edit Team Projects within the team!

### For Teachers: 

As Admins, teachers can create and manage team projects.

1. Click on “Add Team” to begin [creating your first team](./creating-managing-teams#creating-teams). Now you’re the team owner!
2. Give your team a username. (Don’t worry, you can always update your team’s display name later!)
3. [Invite your students and TAs.](./inviting-managing-users) Only the team owner can assign user roles. *Please note that students **must** be added using private invites for your team to be FERPA/COPPA compliant.*
4. Now you can begin [creating projects and assignments](./creating-managing-projects) for your students to complete! 
You can build your own projects from scratch, [import](./creating-managing-projects#copying-projects-to-other-teams) them from your colleagues or other teams, or import them from the Replit [Curriculum Hub](https://replit.com/curriculum)!
