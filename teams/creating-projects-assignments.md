# Creating projects and assignments

Teams for Education include both Team Projects and Team Repls. 

* **Team Projects** are visible and editable only by the teacher and each individual student or student group. These are great for assignments and group projects in which each student/group needs to work independently. 

## Creating Team Projects
From your team dashboard, create a new project.

**Select project language, title, description, due date, and whether this will be a [group project](https://docs.replit.com/teams/group-projects).** You'll be redirected to the IDE to add any comments, tests, and initial coding blocks you'd like your students to start from. You'll assign groups when you publish the project.

### Publishing

When you are done editing your project and it is ready to be published, click "Publish project" from the IDE.

A modal appears, where you can toggle the project between "Published" and "Unpublished".

## Submitting Student Work 

When students have completed their work on the project, they click "Submit" in the IDE header, which will notify all teachers of their submission. Students may continue working on projects and resubmit them after hitting "Submit."
