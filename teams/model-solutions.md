This will create a duplicate of the Team Project that is hidden from students. Teachers may add solution code to this repl and run it against their [unit and I/O tests](https://docs.replit.com/teams/testing-assessments-autograding). 

### Publishing Model Solutions

To publish or update the model solution, click the "Update Solution" button on the top right of the screen. 

Select the check boxes to indicate when students will be able to view the solution.
