# Assigning user roles

You can assign different members of your team different roles.

* **Member:** This is the default role and best for students or other people who don't need special access. They can only view and fork published Team Projects and can view and edit Team Repls. 
* **Admin:** This is for teachers, teaching assistants, etc. It is meant for anyone who will be creating assignments and grading. Admins may create new Team Projects and view student work, but may not change user roles.
* **Owner:** Owners are the user who originally creates a team. Owners can add and change user roles, create Team Projects, and view student work.
* **Organization Admin**: This is the main contact for the full organization. They can create teams and view all teams within an organization, but can only change user roles within the teams they have created/are the owner of.

You can assign roles to members who are part of your team by navigating to your [team dashboard](https://replit.com/teams) and choosing "Manage team members".
