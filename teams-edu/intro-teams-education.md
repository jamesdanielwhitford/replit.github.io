# Introduction to Teams for Education

[Teams for Education](https://replit.com/teams-for-education) adds key workflows for students and teachers on top of all the core Replit features. 

The platform is based around projects, which give students real-world experience. Each project can have multiple versions (often, one for each student or group), so students can all start from the same point, but extend the base project in different ways. 

Projects can also be organized into units, which give teachers the ability to create curricula that not only structure their courses but can be shared with other educators.

## How to Sign Up
Furthermore, these projects can be accessed by different users in different ways. When getting started with Teams for Education, it's important to understand what these roles are and how they are defined within the platform. The different users are defined below:

* **Member:** This is the default role and best for students or other people who don't need special access. They can only view and fork published Team Projects and can view and edit Team Repls. 
* **Admin:** This is for teachers, teaching assistants, etc. It is meant for anyone who will be creating assignments and grading. Admins may create new Team Projects and view student work, but may not change user roles.
* **Owner:** Owners are the user who originally creates a team. Owners can add and change user roles, create Team Projects, and view student work.
* **Organization Admin**: This is the main contact for the full organization. They can create teams and view all teams within an organization, but can only change user roles within the teams they have created/are the owner of.
