# How to manage and copy repls for interviewing

If you're using Replit for technical interviews, you'll probably want to use one or more template repls. For each candidate, you can create a copy of the tempalte repl for that role. This lets you keep a record of each candidate's work.

In this tutorial, we cover how to:

* fork a repl for multiple interviews
* add a naming convention to interview repls
* organize candidate interviews
* remove candidates from completed interviews
* perform code reviews

## Forking template repls

To get started, navigate to your team's dashboard and create a template repl (e.g backend-dev-python) which would consist of all the material you need to interview for a backend Python role.

Once the repl has been created, you can click on the repl name on the top left side of your workspace. On the pop-up window, click on the three-dot menu next to the 'Spotlight page' button. Click on the 'Fork' option to create a fork (copy) of the repl.

Choose the owner of the new forked repl in the pop-up window. Select your team's name and then click the 'Confirm' button.

You will then be redirected to the workspace of the copied repl and here you can modify the repl as you see fit.

## Adding a naming convention

You can invite a candidate and interview them using the forked repl in order to keep your template clean. For more details on how to invite candidates to interviews, you can follow this tutorial: [Interviewing candidates with Guest Mode](https://docs.replit.com/teams-pro/interviewing-candidates)

At the end of the interview, save the repl with the candidate's name or some other identifier on it. For example, you could use a naming convention like 'backend-dev-python-2022-01-21-jane-doe') to make it easier to find if there have been numerous candidates for the same type of interview.

## Organizing interview templates 

To keep track of your templates, you can group them into collections, which is a feature of Teams Pro. 

On the team dashboard, there are plus and list buttons on the right side of the screen, next to the 'Create Team Repl' button.

To name and create a new collection, click on the plus button.

You can add interview repls to the collection by dragging them in. You can also arrange these in any order.

## Removing candidates from completed interview repls

Once an interview with a candidate is complete, you can remove their access to the repl so that they cannot modify the code that they wrote during the interview.

To do so, open the candidate's interview repl and then click the invite button, find the candidate's username or email and click on the 'x' button beside it.

This will make sure the candidate can not open the repl after the interview or be able to make extra changes to it.

## Performing code review

You can review candidates' code using by creating notes on the repl about their overall coding solutions or sections of it. This lets you share notes, scores, or anything you want with the rest of the hiring team.

To add a note, right click on a line or selection of code and choose "Add note".

In the text field add any comments you have on the candidate's code and then click the button next to the text field which will be blue once you have typed something in.

You can also add collaborators by tagging them in your comment by typing `@<their username>` to bring their attention to the repl.
