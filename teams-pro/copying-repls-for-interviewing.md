# How to manage multiple interviews

Replit enables us to fork team repls which we can modify and reuse as often as possible. We can copy repls used for interviews to reuse the same content for different candidates. This is done by creating a `template` repl which we can reuse several times. 

In this tutorial, we cover how to:

* fork a repl for multiple interviews
* add a naming convention to interview repls
* organize candidate interviews
* remove candidates from completed interviews
* perform code reviews

## Forking template repls

To get started, navigate to your teams' dashboard and create a template repl (e.g backend-dev-python) which would consist of all the material you need for the interview.

Once the repl has been created, you can click on the repl name on the top left side of your workspace. On the pop-up window, click on the three-dot menu next to the 'Spotlight page' button. Click on the 'Fork' option to create a fork of the repl.

Choose the owner of the new forked repl in the pop-up window. Select your team's name and then click the 'Confirm' button.

You will then be redirected to the new repls workspace and here you can modify the repl as you see fit.

## Adding a naming convention

You can invite a candidate and interview them using the forked repl. For more details on how to invite candidates to interviews, you can follow this tutorial: [Interviewing candidates with Guest Mode](https://docs.replit.com/teams-pro/interviewing-candidates)

At the end of the interview, save the repl with their name on it (e.g using a naming convention like 'backend-dev-python-2022-01-21-jane-doe') to make it easier to find if there have been numerous candidates for the same type of interview.

## Organizing candidate interviews

To have more structure on our team, we can create a collection for all the candidate interviews we conduct. Teams Pro lets you organize or group your projects into collections.

 On the team dashboard, there are plus and list buttons on the right side of the screen, next to the 'Create Team Repl' button.

To name and create a new collection, click on the plus button.

 You can add the interview repls to it by dragging them into the newly created collection. You can also arrange them in any order.

## Removing candidates from completed interview repls

Once an interview with a candidate is complete, we can remove further access to the interview so that they cannot modify the repl after the interview.

To do so, open the candidate's interview repl and then click the invite button, find the candidate's username or email and click on the 'x' button beside it.

This will make sure the candidate can not open the repl after the interview or be able to make extra changes to it.

## Performing code review

We can review candidates' code using by creating notes on the repl about their overall coding solutions or sections of it. This allows us to share our input with other collaborators also performing reviews.


To add a note, point to the section of code on which you would like to add a note, right click on your mouse, and select 'start thread'.

In the text field add any comments you have on the candidate's code and then click the button next to the text field which will be blue once you have typed something in.

You can also add collaborators by tagging them in your comment by typing `@<their username>` to bring their attention to the repl.
